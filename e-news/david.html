        <h2>David Hundeyin: FG Sent Two NIA Agents To Kidnap Me In Accra</h2>
            <img src="david1.png" width="400"><br>
            <p>This document could have cost me my life. They actually sent NIA field agents to Accra to abduct me 
            because of it. </p>
            <p>One of them sent me a message saying, "I will make sure I personally end your life 
            for betraying Nigeria."</p>
            <p>Well, abobi, as you can see, I am not dead, and that war I stopped from 
            happening is never going to happen now.</p>
            <p>Shout out to Aliyu Gebi at the DIA and Ahmed Rufai Abubakar 
            over at the NIA. You 2 hungry jobbers will never know how close you came to getting me in Accra. Or 
            maybe you'll find out alongside everyone else when my book comes out in January.</p>
            <p> Anyway, @PresidenceNiger you're welcome 
            <br>Amandla! Awethu!
