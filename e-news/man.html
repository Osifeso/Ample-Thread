        <p>The Police, on Tuesday, arraigned a 20-year-old man, Adeleke Temitope, before an Ado-Ekiti Magistrateâ€™s Court for allegedly abducting a 15-year-old girl.</p>
        <p>The defendant, of no fixed address, is standing trial on a charge of unlawful abduction.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Insp Sodiq Adeniyi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Aug. 30 in Ikere-Ekiti.</p>
        <p>Adeniyi said the defendant unlawfully abducted one Adeyemi Ayomide, a 15-year-old girl, against her will.</p>
        <p>The offence, according to him, contravenes Section 275 of the Criminal Laws of Ekiti State, 2021.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor urged the court to adjourn the case to enable him study the file and assemble his witnesses.</p>
        <p>The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against him.</p>
        <p>His counsel, Mr Benjamin Aladesuyi, urged the court to grant his client bail, with a promise that he would not jump bail.</p>
