           <p>The victim, a 23-year-old lady (name withheld), heading to Iyana Oworo from Gerard Road Ikoyi, boarded the suspects' Volkswagen Vento salon car with registration number BDG 513 EJ but was forcibly taken to Idumota.</p>
            <p div="style">Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested three fraudsters in Idumota, Lagos, while they were holding an uncooperative victim hostage.</p>
            <p div="style"> The three suspects, Austin Okoro ‘m’ aged 47, ring leader, Godwin Asezour ‘m’ aged 54 and Susan Elohor ‘f’ aged 42, while on the diversion, attempted to swindle their victim by ostensibly introducing her to their alleged money-doubling business.</p>

            <p div="style"> The victim, however, sighted an RRS patrol team at Idumota and successfully raised the alarm to their hearing, which led to the prompt arrest of the suspects.</p>
            <p div="style"> The suspects have since been charged to court following completion of investigation by the CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi-led RRS.</p>
